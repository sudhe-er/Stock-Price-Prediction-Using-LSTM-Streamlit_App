# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM-Streamlit_App
Here, Built a Streamlit Price Prediction Web App using Streamlit-a Python Web Framework which is mostly used in Data Science & Machine Learning.
To make predictions on the historical Stock prices, we have used LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory), a Deep Learning Neural Network.
So, in this we have predicted the future stock prices with the help of the testing dataset along with the training dataset and compared it with data present in the training dataset values.
That means, we have only predicted that whether this model is able to capture the stock market trends or not!!!
